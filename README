We divided our project into a set of linked c files with their respective header fields.  These files include build_spec.c/build_spec.h, command.c/command.h, graph.c/graph.h, list.c/list.h, main.c/main.h, parser.c/parser.h, and tools.c/tools.h.

The program defines build_t, a structure holding a character pointer toa target, double character pointers to dependencies and commands, and two integers representing the amount of dependencies and commands in the build respectively. Build_spec.c defines some helper functions to initialize a buld_t structure and add dependencies and commands, while tools.c defines a malloc wrapper function which build_spec uses to allocate memory.  In addition, list_t is defined as a list of build_t structures, and parser.c is responsible for reading in the input from a text file and returing a list of valid builds. Parser.c defines local functions to get the index of the target of a build as well as return the new line in a build which is returned when valid, iterated if pointer points to empty line, or returns NULL is file reaches the end of stream.
